               which severely restrict the body and limbs. The present study
               explored the variability and use of containment devices in U.S.
               and Tajik infants. Using time diaries, we compared 12-month-olds
               in the U.S. and Tajikistan on the types of containments used and
               time spent in them throughout the day. During the day, Tajik
               infants accumulated more time in gahvoras than infants in the
               U.S. spent in cribs, primarily used for sleep, suggesting
               gahvoras served other functions. Given the availability of other
               devices, U.S. infants' time was distributed in short yet frequent
               bouts across devices. Accumulated time in these containments
               matched accumulated time Tajik infants spent in gahvoras. Tajik
               infants accumulated more unrestricted time on the ground, which
               was distributed in prolonged bouts, than U.S. infants. Findings
               highlight differences in infants' everyday experiences during the

               time diaries to determine the distribution of time infants spent

               of young children. However, there have been no studies on
               stroller use as it relates to physical activity outcomes. The
               objectives of this study were to understand the context of
               stroller use for young children and parents' perceptions of the
               relationship between stroller use and their children's physical
               activity. METHODS: Parents of children 1 to 5 years of age were
               recruited through two sites of TARGet Kids!, a primary-care,
               practice-based research network in Toronto, Canada. Fourteen
               semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interviews were audio
               recorded and transcribed verbatim and two independent reviewers
               conducted thematic analysis. A number of strategies were employed
               to ensure the trustworthiness of the data. RESULTS: Parents
               discussed reasons for stroller use (i.e., transportation;
               storage; leisure; supervision/confinement; parent physical
               activity; and sleep), factors that influence the decision to use
               a stroller (i.e., caregiver choice; convenience, timing,
               distance; family lifestyle; and child preference), and perceived
               impact of stroller use on physical activity (i.e., most parents
               did not recognize a connection between stroller use and physical
               activity). CONCLUSION: This study provides a context for
               researchers and policy makers to consider when developing

              looking at the partner's face by seating infants and caregivers
              face to face in stationary positions. In less constrained
              conditions when both partners are freely mobile, infants and
              caregivers must move their heads and bodies to look at each other.
              We hypothesized that face looking and mutual gaze for each member
              of the dyad would decrease with increased motor costs of looking.
              To test this hypothesis, 12-month-old crawling and walking infants
              and their parents wore head-mounted eye trackers to record eye
              movements of each member of the dyad during locomotor free play in
              a large toy-filled playroom. Findings revealed that increased
              motor costs decreased face looking and mutual gaze: Each partner
              looked less at the other's face when their own posture or the

              spending more time down on the ground when infants were prone,
              perhaps to facilitate face looking. Infants looked more at toys
              than at their caregiver's face, but caregivers looked at their
              infant's face and at toys in equal amounts. Furthermore, infants
              looked less at toys and faces compared to studies that used
              stationary tasks, suggesting that the attentional demands differ

               Gibson, 1966, 1979) provides the framework for the view of
               perceptual development we present here. It is a theory about
               perceiving by active creatures who look and listen and move
               around. It is a theory about everyday perceiving in the world,
               and it differs greatly from theories that begin with a motionless
               creature haplessly bombarded by stimuli. Perceiving creatures are
               part of a world from which they seek information and in which
               they use it. Perceiving begins at least as soon as an animal is
               born and well it should, for its function is to keep an animal in
               touch with the environment around it. The ecological approach
               takes as its unit of study the animal in its environment,
               considered as an interactive system. The relations within this
               system are reciprocal, with the reciprocity including a species
               evolving in an environment to which it becomes adapted, and an
               individual acting in its own niche, developing and learning.",

               perception, spatial cognition, and social and emotional
               development. Through a synthesis of published and hitherto
               unpublished findings, gathered from a number of converging
               research designs and methods, this article provides a
               comprehensive review and reanalysis of the consequences of
               self-produced locomotor experience. Specifically, we focus on the
               role of locomotor experience in changes in social and emotional
               development, referential gestural communication, wariness of
               heights, the perception of self-motion, distance perception,
               spatial search, and spatial coding strategies. Our analysis
               reveals new insights into the specific processes by which
               locomotor experience brings about psychological changes. We
               elaborate these processes and provide new predictions about
               previously unsuspected links between locomotor experience and
               psychological function. The research we describe is relevant to
               our broad understanding of the developmental process,
               particularly as it pertains to developmental transitions.
               Although acknowledging the role of genetically mediated
               developmental changes, our viewpoint is a transactional one in
               which a single acquisition, in this case the onset of locomotion,
               sets in motion a family of experiences and processes that in turn
               mobilize both broad-based and context-specific psychological
               reorganizations. We conclude that, in infancy, the onset of
               locomotor experience brings about widespread consequences, and
               after infancy, can be responsible for an enduring role in
               development by maintaining and updating existing skills.",

               indicate there may be significant variability in early motor
               experience across cultures. To better understand whether
               differences in early experience are linked to motor development,
               we observed 52 12-month olds ( SD = .66) with their caregivers in
               three cultural contexts: Tanna (ni-Vanuatu; N = 9), Aka (Central
               African Republic; N = 10), and rural villages in Tajikistan ( N =
               33). We coded the videos to determine the duration of time
               infants spent restricted, the time they engaged in spontaneous
               movement, and the ways in which they were restriction. When
               unrestricted, infants spent similar proportions of time exploring
               their environment through locomotion across the three cultural
               groups. However, Tajik infants were restricted from movement more
               than infants in Vanuatu and the Aka community. Restriction
               duration did not correlate with infants’ movement duration.
               Notably, Tajik caregivers primarily used devices for restriction,
               while ni-Vanuatu and Aka caregivers relied on holding. These
               variations in parental choices and how they shape children’s
               early environments provide insights into how caregiving practices
               influence the context of motor development across cultures. While
               previous studies highlight direct parenting practices’ influence
               on motor development, our findings suggest indirect practices may

               in five positions: lying prone, lying supine, held in-arms, held
               in a baby carrier, and buckled into a car seat. Mean filtered EMG
               signal and time that muscles were active were calculated. Paired
               t-tests were used to compare positions to the prone condition.
               Caregivers reported that infants spent 12\% of daily awake time
               prone, 43\% in supine-lying baby gear, and 44\% held in-arms or
               upright in a baby carrier. Infants exhibited highest erector
               spinae activity when prone, and lowest cervical paraspinal muscle
               activity in the car seat. No differences were found between
               in-arms carrying and babywearing. This first evaluation of the
               muscle activity of healthy infants supports the importance of
               prone time in infants' early spinal development because it
               promotes neck and back muscle activity. Carrying babies in-arms
               or in baby carriers may also be beneficial to neck muscle
               development, while prolonged time spent in car seats or
               containment devices may be detrimental to spinal development.",

               from spontaneous activity during free play. Locomotor experience
               was immense: Twelve- to 19-month-olds averaged 2,368 steps and 17

               crawlers to transition to walking. After walking onset, natural
               locomotion improved dramatically: Infants took more steps,

               distributed in short bouts with variable paths--frequently too

               motor scores were close to normative standards (AIMS 47.7, SD

               in a normative sample. Remarkably, 22\% of our sample exhibited
               gross motor delays (quotient <78). Tummy time (awake) was

               gyroscope data collection during movements. Using this suit, we
               first recorded play sessions of 22 typically developing infants

               annotated for infant posture and movement based on video

               specifically designed to assess the overall movement pattern of

               this uncertainty for performance improvements in training of the
               automated classifier. Comparison of different sensor

               Novel wearable technology opens possibilities for characterizing

               validate a generalizable, scalable, and effective method to
               measure infants' spontaneous motor abilities across all motor
               milestones from lying supine to fluent walking. Methods: A
               multi-sensor infant wearable was constructed, and 59 infants (age
               5-19 months) were recorded during their spontaneous play. A novel
               gross motor description scheme was used for human visual
               classification of postures and movements at a second-level time
               resolution. A deep learning -based classifier was then trained to
               mimic human annotations, and aggregated recording-level outputs
               were used to provide posture- and movement-specific developmental
               trajectories, which enabled more holistic assessments of motor
               maturity. Results: Recordings were technically successful in all
               infants, and the algorithmic analysis showed
               human-equivalent-level accuracy in quantifying the observed
               postures and movements. The aggregated recordings were used to
               train an algorithm for predicting a novel neurodevelopmental
               measure, Baba Infant Motor Score (BIMS). This index estimates
               maturity of infants' motor abilities, and it correlates very
               strongly (Pearson's r = 0.89, p < 1e-20) to the chronological age
               of the infant. Conclusions: The results show that out-of-hospital
               assessment of infants' motor ability is possible using a
               multi-sensor wearable. The algorithmic analysis provides metrics
               of motility that are transparent, objective, intuitively
               interpretable, and they link strongly to infants' age. Such a
               solution could be automated and scaled to a global extent,
               holding promise for functional benchmarking in individualized
               patient care or early intervention trials.",

               available in homes with small infants and how often they are used
               for infants who are too young to sit erect and unsupported.
               DESIGN: Observational study using a questionnaire administered to
               a cohort of parents of well infants younger than 5 months.
               SETTING: Well-Baby Clinic, Department of Pediatrics, Tripler Army
               Medical Center, a tertiary care center serving the population of
               military dependents on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. RESULTS:
               Infant seating devices were available in the homes of all of the
               infants whose parents completed the questionnaire during the
               study. Of 187 infants, 176 (94\%) spent 30 minutes or longer in
               seating devices each day. The mean (tSD) time spent each day in
               seating devices was 5.7 +/- 3.5 hours and ranged from 0 to 16
               hours. CONCLUSIONS: Seating devices were widely available for use
               in the care of the infants. Car seats that double as infant
               carriers and infant seats likely are being used extensively
               outside of automobiles. Prolonged use of infant seating devices
               with infants who are too young to sit unsupported may have
               several potential adverse consequences.",

               at-home studies where development of infants' neurobehavior is
               measured using wearable devices. Here, we first developed a
               phenomenological categorization for physical infant-caregiver
               interactions to support five different definitions of C/H
               behaviors. Then, we trained and assessed deep learning-based
               classifiers for their automatic detection from multi-sensor
               wearable recordings that were originally used for mobile
               assessment of infants' motor development. Our results show that
               an automated C/H detection is feasible at few-second temporal
               accuracy. With the best C/H definition, the automated detector
               shows 96\% accuracy and 0.56 kappa, which is slightly less than

               varies with C/H definition reflecting the extent to which
               infants' movements are present in each C/H variant. A systematic
               benchmarking experiment shows that the widely used
               actigraphy-based method ignores the normally occurring C/H
               behaviors. Finally, we show proof-of-concept for the utility of
               the novel classifier in studying C/H behavior across infant
               development. Particularly, we show that matching the C/H

               Therefore, the attainment of motor milestones is expected to play
               a role in cognitive-linguistic development. Early attainment of
               unsupported sitting and independent walking indeed predict better

               and evidence regarding factors that might mediate this relation
               are scarce. The current study examined whether exploration of
               spatial-relational object properties (e.g., the possibility of
               containing or stacking) and exploration of the space through
               self-locomotion mediate the effect of, respectively, age of
               sitting and age of walking on spatial cognition and spatial

               self-locomotion, which in turn, predict better spatial cognition

               development, exploratory behavior (age 20 months), spatial memory
               (age 24 months), spatial processing (age 32 months), and spatial

               predicted spatial memory and spatial language, but
               spatial-relational object exploration did not mediate these
               effects. Attainment of independent walking predicted spatial
               processing and spatial language, and exploration through
               self-locomotion (partially) mediated these relations. These

               (i) which accelerometer should be used, (ii) where the

               domain features to identify the physical activities is proposed
               in this paper; it uses sensors placed on the subjects' wrist,
               chest and ankle. A feature set based on time domain
               characteristics of the acceleration signal recorded by
               acceleration sensors is proposed for the classification of twelve
               physical activities. Nine subjects performed twelve different
               types of physical activities, including sitting, standing,
               walking, running, cycling, Nordic walking, ascending stairs,
               descending stairs, vacuum cleaning, ironing clothes and jumping
               rope, and lying down (resting state). Their ages were 27.2 ± 3.3
               years and their body mass index (BMI) is 25.11 ± 2.6 Kg/m2.
               Classification results demonstrated a high validity showing
               precision (a positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity)
               of more than 95\% for all physical activities. The overall
               classification accuracy for a combined feature set of three

               the physical activities of a subject that can be very useful for

               extraction methods have been used to identify different
               activities from a range of different datasets. In this paper, we
               present a comparison of 14 methods to extract classification
               features from accelerometer signals. These are based on the
               wavelet transform and other well-known time- and frequency-domain
               signal characteristics. To allow an objective comparison between
               the different features, we used two datasets of activities
               collected from 20 subjects. The first set comprised three
               commonly used activities, namely, level walking, stair ascent,
               and stair descent, and the second a total of eight activities.

               vital step for progressing the time-use epidemiology field. Past
               accelerometer-based measurement protocols are either hindered by
               lack of wear time compliance, or the inability to accurately
               discern activities and postures. Recent work has indicated that
               skin-attached dual-accelerometers exhibit excellent 24-h
               uninterrupted wear time compliance. This study extends this work
               by validating this system for classifying various physical
               activities and sedentary behaviors in children and adults.
               METHODS: Seventy-five participants (42 children) were equipped
               with two Axivity AX3 accelerometers; one attached to their thigh,
               and one to their lower back. Ten activity trials (e.g., sitting,
               standing, lying, walking, running) were performed while under
               direct observation in a lab setting. Various time- and
               frequency-domain features were computed from raw accelerometer
               data, which were then used to train a random forest machine
               learning classifier. Model performance was evaluated using
               leave-one-out cross-validation. The efficacy of the dual-sensor
               protocol (relative to single sensors) was evaluated by repeating
               the modeling process with each sensor individually. RESULTS:
               Machine learning models were able to differentiate between six
               distinct activity classes with exceptionally high accuracy in
               both adults (99.1\%) and children (97.3\%). When a single thigh
               or back accelerometer was used, there was a pronounced drop in
               accuracy for nonambulatory activities (up to a 26.4\% decline).
               When examining the features used for model training, those that
               took the orientation of both sensors into account concurrently
               were more important predictors. CONCLUSIONS: When previous wear
               time compliance results are taken together with our findings, it
               represents a promising step forward for monitoring and
               understanding 24-h time-use behaviors. The next step will be to
               examine the generalizability of these findings in a free-living
               setting.",

  abstract = "Background: Human movement activity is commonly recorded with
              inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors in many science
              disciplines. The IMU data can be used for an algorithmic detection
              of different postures and movements, which may support more
              detailed assessments of complex behaviors, such as daily
              activities. Studies on human behavior in real-life environments
              need to strike a balance between simplifying the recording
              settings and preserving sufficient analytic gains. It is poorly
              understood, however, what the trade-offs are between alternative
              recording configurations and the attainable analyses of
              naturalistic behavior at different levels of inspection, or with
              respect to achievable scientific questions. Objective: This study
              assessed systematically the effects of IMU recording
              configurations (placement and number of IMU sensors, sampling
              frequency, and sensor modality) on the high temporal resolution
              detections of postures and movements, and on their lower temporal
              resolution derivative statistics when the data represents
              naturalistic daily activity without excessively repetitive
              movements. Methods: We used a dataset from spontaneously moving
              infants (N=41; age range 4-18 months) recorded with a multisensor
              wearable suit. The analysis benchmark was obtained using human
              annotations of postures and movements from a synchronously
              recorded video, and the reference IMU recording configuration
              included 4 IMU sensors collecting triaxial accelerometer and
              gyroscope modalities at 52 Hz. Then, we systematically tested how
              the algorithmic classification of postures (N=7), and movements
              (N=9), as well as their distributions and a derivative motor
              performance score, are affected by reducing IMU data sampling
              frequency, sensor modality, and sensor placement. Results: Our
              results show that reducing the number of sensors has a significant
              effect on classifier performance, and the single sensor
              configurations were nonfeasible (posture classification Cohen
              kappa<0.75; movement<0.45). Reducing sensor modalities to
              accelerometer only, that is, dropping gyroscope data, leads to a
              modest reduction in movement classification performance
              (kappa=0.50-0.53). However, the sampling frequency could be
              reduced from 52 to 6 Hz with negligible effects on the
              classifications (posture kappa=0.90-0.92; movement=0.56-0.58).
              Conclusions: The present findings highlight the significant
              trade-offs between IMU recording configurations and the
              attainability of sufficiently reliable analyses at different
              levels. Notably, the single-sensor recordings employed in most of
              the literature and wearable solutions are of very limited use when
              assessing the key aspects of real-world movement behavior at
              relevant temporal resolutions. The minimal configuration with an
              acceptable classifier performance includes at least a combination
              of one upper and one lower extremity sensor, at least 13 Hz
              sampling frequency, and at least an accelerometer, but preferably
              also a gyroscope (posture kappa=0.89-0.91; movement=0.50-0.53).
              These findings have direct implications for the design of future
              studies and wearable solutions that aim to quantify spontaneously
              occurring postures and movements in natural behaviors.",

               caregiving, given that human infants have evolved a capacity to
               cling onto an upright caregiver whose body co-evolved to enable
               offspring carrying. The origins of this mutual adaptation may
               date back 4 million years, with the emergence of bipedalism,
               which precluded the infant horizontal and gravity-supported
               position on the back of a quadrupedal caregiver. We describe
               infant cooperative reflexes and behaviors, including the
               carrying-induced calming response and discuss hypotheses for the
               invention of infant carrier tools. Carrying involves several
               physiological and behavioral parent-infant co-adaptations that

               Specifically, the primary objective was to examine the
               longitudinal associations of infant physical activity (i.e.,
               tummy time) and sedentary behaviour (i.e., back time, screen
               time, reading time, restrained time) with gross motor
               development. Secondary and tertiary objectives were to examine
               longitudinal associations of: (1) infant physical activity and
               sedentary behaviour with communication, fine motor,
               personal-social, and problem solving development, and (2) sleep
               time with primary and secondary outcomes. METHODS: Participants
               were 411 parents and their infants from the Early Movers project
               in Edmonton, Canada. Physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and
               sleep were measured with a parental questionnaire and the Ages \&
               Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) developmental screening tool was
               administered at 2, 4, and 6 months. Parents reported the dates
               six major gross motor milestones (i.e., independent sitting,
               crawling, assisted standing, assisted walking, independent
               standing, independent walking) were acquired in the first 18
               months of life according to World Health Organization criteria.
               In a subsample (n = 125), gross motor development was assessed
               using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) at 6 months. RESULTS:
               Higher tummy time across time points was significantly associated
               with higher ASQ-3 gross motor and personal-social development
               scores over time, higher total AIMS scores at 6 months, and
               earlier acquisition of all gross motor milestones. Higher reading
               time across time points was significantly associated with higher
               ASQ-3 fine motor, gross motor, personal-social, and total
               development scores over time. In contrast, higher back time
               across time points was significantly associated with lower total
               AIMS scores at 6 months and the later acquisition of assisted
               standing, assisted walking, and independent walking. Similarly,
               higher restrained time across time points was significantly
               associated with a later acquisition of supported walking.
               CONCLUSIONS: Tummy time was consistently longitudinally
               associated with more advanced gross motor development and reading
               with more advanced total development. Whereas, some detrimental
               associations were observed for back and restrained time. Findings
               support the promotion of tummy time and certain sedentary
               behaviours (i.e., reading) in young infants to enhance overall
               development.",

               dynamic systems perspective, the interaction between environment,
               tasks, and organismic constraints leads to the emergence of new
               behaviors over time. This 6-month longitudinal study aimed to
               verify associations between the emergence of locomotor behaviors
               and infants' characteristics, developmental status, parental
               beliefs, and practices. This observational study remotely
               assessed 37 full-term Brazilian infants aged 5 to 15 months,
               divided into two groups (G1: 5 to 11 months, n = 19; and G2: 9 to
               15 months, n = 18). The motor developmental status of infants was
               closely associated with the emergence of behaviors (p < 0.05).
               Infants in G2 whose parents agreed with the statement ``In
               typically developing infants, motor development occurs naturally
               and there is no need to actively stimulate it'' started to walk
               later than those whose parents disagreed. Infants whose parents
               expected them to walk around 10-11 months walked earlier compared
               to those expected to walk after 11 months (G2, p = 0.011).
               Infants in G2 with a high frequency of staying in the supine
               position started to walk, both with and without support, later
               than those with a low frequency (p < 0.05). For infants in G1
               with a high frequency of playing on the floor, locomotion (p =
               0.041) and crawling on hands-and-knees (p = 0.007) started sooner
               compared to those with a low frequency. Staying in the cradle
               more frequently was related to a later emergence of supported
               walk (p = 0.046) among infants in G2. The emergence of locomotor
               behaviors is associated with motor developmental status, the
               surfaces where the infant plays, and body position. Parental
               beliefs and expectations influence how infants are stimulated
               and, consequently, the emergence of independent walking.",

               opportunities for early intervention that are crucial for
               promoting healthy growth and development. The manual
               classification of human body position based on video recordings
               is labour-intensive, leading to the adoption of Inertial Motion
               Unit (IMU) sensors. IMUs measure acceleration, angular velocity,
               and magnetic field intensity, enabling the automated
               classification of body position. Many research teams are
               currently employing supervised machine learning classifiers that
               utilise hand-crafted features for data segment classification. In
               this study, we used a longitudinal dataset of IMU recordings made
               in the lab in three different play activities of infants aged
               4-12 months. The classification was conducted based on manually

               of evening crying. We hypothesized that this ``normal'' crying

               carrying throughout the day in addition to that which occurs
               during feeding and in response to crying. In a randomized
               controlled trial, 99 mother-infant pairs were assigned to an
               increased carrying or control group. At the time of peak crying
               (6 weeks of age), infants who received supplemental carrying
               cried and fussed 43\% less (1.23 v 2.16 h/d) overall, and 51\%
               less (0.63 v 1.28 hours) during the evening hours (4 PM to

               of life. The relative lack of carrying in our society may

               physical contact with infants (via co-sleeping and babywearing)
               predicted increased likelihood of self-reported responsive

               physical activity across the domains of maternal beliefs and
               behaviours, infant behaviours and the home environment. METHODS:
               Data from 206 toddlers (53\% male) participating in the Melbourne
               InFANT Program were collected in 2008-2010 and analysed in 2012.
               Mothers completed a survey of physical activity predictors when
               their child was 4- (T1) and 9- months old (T2). Physical activity
               was assessed by ActiGraph GT1M accelerometers at 19- months (T3)
               of age. RESULTS: One infant behaviour at T1 and one maternal
               belief and two infant behaviours at T2 showed associations with
               physical activity at T3 and were included in multivariate
               analyses. After adjusting for the age at which the child started
               walking and maternal education, the time spent with babies of a
               similar age at 4-months (β = 0.06, 95\% CI [0.02, 0.10]) and the
               time spent being physically active with their mother at 9-months

               peer-interactions and maternal-child co-participation in physical
               activity could serve as a health promotion strategy to increase

               using an Axivity AX3 wrist-worn accelerometer for one week and
               the mean vector magnitude was calculated. In addition, mothers
               reported the average amount of time their infant spent in various
               types of activities (including in front of the TV), their beliefs
               about infants' physical activity, access to equipment in the home
               environment, and ages of motor development milestone attainment.
               Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and pair-wise correlations were used
               to test age and sex differences and associations with potential
               correlates. RESULTS: There were significant age and sex effects
               on the distribution of time spent at different physical activity
               intensities (Wilks' lambda = 0.06, p < 0.01). In all cases, the
               trend was for boys to spend more time in higher intensity
               physical activity and less time in lower intensity activity than
               girls; and for time spent in higher intensity activities to be
               higher in older children. Time spent outside was higher in boys,
               and this reached significance at 18-months (F = 3.84, p = 0.02).
               Less concern around floor play was associated with higher
               physical activity at 12-months in females only (p = 0.03, r =
               0.54), and no other maternal beliefs were correlated with
               physical activity. The majority (94\%) of children were exceeding
               TV time recommendations. When controlling for age and sex,
               overall TV time was positively associated with BMI z-score
               (β=0.01, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show
               sex and age differences in the patterns of physical activity, and
               to report on objectively measured and maternal reported physical
               activity and sedentary behaviour in the first two years of life
               in South Africa infants. Infants and toddlers should be provided
               with as many opportunities to be active through play as possible,
               and TV time should be limited.",

               behaviours in their young children, little is known about how
               parents view their role in shaping physical activity and screen
               time behaviours. METHODS: Using an unstructured focus group
               design, parental views and practices around children's physical
               activity and screen time (television and computer use) were
               explored with eight groups of new parents (n=61; child age <12
               months) and eight groups of parents with preschool-aged (3-5 year
               old) children (n=36) in Melbourne, Australia. RESULTS: Parents
               generally believed children are naturally active, which may
               preclude their engagement in strategies designed to increase
               physical activity. While parents across both age groups shared
               many overarching views concerning parenting for children's
               physical activity and screen time behaviours, some strategies and
               barriers differed depending on the age of the child. While most
               new parents were optimistic about their ability to positively
               influence their child's behaviours, many parents of
               preschool-aged children seemed more resigned to strategies that
               worked for them, even when aware such strategies may not be
               ideal. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions aiming to increase children's
               physical activity and decrease screen time may need to tailor
               strategies to the age group of the child and address parents'
               misconceptions and barriers to optimum parenting in these
               domains.",

               care, this setting presents an ideal opportunity to promote
               physical activity and the early development of healthy behaviors.
               The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships
               between the childcare environment and physical activity behavior
               of preschool children. METHODS: Aspects of the environment
               hypothesized to influence children's physical activity were
               assessed in 20 childcare centers using the Environment and Policy
               Assessment and Observation (EPAO) instrument. Physical activity
               behavior was assessed over 2 days using direct observation.
               RESULTS: Children in centers with supportive environments
               achieved more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (15\% of
               observations vs 9\%; effect size [ES]=1.17), spent less time in
               sedentary activities (50\% vs 61\%; ES=-1.52), and had higher
               mean physical activity levels (2.68 vs 2.43; ES=1.41) compared to
               centers with less supportive environments. Facets of the physical
               and social environment related to physical activity behavior
               included active opportunities, portable play equipment, fixed
               play equipment, sedentary environment, and physical activity
               training and education. CONCLUSIONS: Previous research indicates
               that the childcare center that children attend significantly
               affects physical activity behavior. The current findings extend
               this evidence by identifying aspects of the childcare environment
               that relate to the physical activity behavior of children. These
               factors should be considered when identifying determinants of
               physical activity and designing interventions.",

               analysed whether parental influences predicted their child's
               motor competence for active play. Data from the InFANT cohort
               study, collected at ages 5 and 9.5 years, included 199
               parent-child pairs. Parents self-reported on their parenting
               efficacy (α = 0.76), facilitation (α = 0.74) and attitude (α =
               0.58) towards children's PA at age 5. At 9.5 years, parents
               proxy-reported their child's motor competence for active play.
               Separate and multivariate regression models tested the three
               parenting constructs as predictors of motor competence for active
               play, adjusted for covariates (child sex, socioeconomic position,
               child's 5-year motor competence). Parental efficacy (β = 0.25),
               facilitation (β = 0.29) and attitude (β = 0.25) each served as
               significant predictors of motor competence for active play in the
               separate models. In the multivariate model, parental facilitation
               (β = 0.20, p < 0.01) dominated the predictive power for
               children's motor competence for active play; attitude (β = 0.17,
               p = 0.03) still had a significant effect but not efficacy (β =
               0.13, p = 0.15). The findings highlight the importance of
               targeting parents in promoting children's development of motor
               competence, with a focus on effective facilitation of physically
               active lifestyles in unstructured activity contexts.",
