               which severely restrict the body and limbs. The present study

               and Tajik infants. Using time diaries, we compared 12-month-olds
               in the U.S. and Tajikistan on the types of containments used and
               time spent in them throughout the day. During the day, Tajik
               infants accumulated more time in gahvoras than infants in the
               U.S. spent in cribs, primarily used for sleep, suggesting
               gahvoras served other functions. Given the availability of other
               devices, U.S. infants' time was distributed in short yet frequent
               bouts across devices. Accumulated time in these containments
               matched accumulated time Tajik infants spent in gahvoras. Tajik
               infants accumulated more unrestricted time on the ground, which
               was distributed in prolonged bouts, than U.S. infants. Findings
               highlight differences in infants' everyday experiences during the
               developmental period when motor skills emerge. By embracing
               commonalities and exploring differences between cultures, this
               study offers insights into differences in infants' everyday
               experiences and opportunities for movement.",

               time diaries to determine the distribution of time infants spent

               of young children. However, there have been no studies on
               stroller use as it relates to physical activity outcomes. The
               objectives of this study were to understand the context of
               stroller use for young children and parents' perceptions of the
               relationship between stroller use and their children's physical
               activity. METHODS: Parents of children 1 to 5 years of age were
               recruited through two sites of TARGet Kids!, a primary-care,
               practice-based research network in Toronto, Canada. Fourteen
               semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interviews were audio
               recorded and transcribed verbatim and two independent reviewers
               conducted thematic analysis. A number of strategies were employed
               to ensure the trustworthiness of the data. RESULTS: Parents
               discussed reasons for stroller use (i.e., transportation;
               storage; leisure; supervision/confinement; parent physical
               activity; and sleep), factors that influence the decision to use
               a stroller (i.e., caregiver choice; convenience, timing,
               distance; family lifestyle; and child preference), and perceived
               impact of stroller use on physical activity (i.e., most parents
               did not recognize a connection between stroller use and physical
               activity). CONCLUSION: This study provides a context for
               researchers and policy makers to consider when developing

              mainstay of developmental research. However, common laboratory
              paradigms for studying dyadic interaction oversimplify the act of
              looking at the partner's face by seating infants and caregivers
              face to face in stationary positions. In less constrained
              conditions when both partners are freely mobile, infants and
              caregivers must move their heads and bodies to look at each other.
              We hypothesized that face looking and mutual gaze for each member
              of the dyad would decrease with increased motor costs of looking.
              To test this hypothesis, 12-month-old crawling and walking infants
              and their parents wore head-mounted eye trackers to record eye
              movements of each member of the dyad during locomotor free play in
              a large toy-filled playroom. Findings revealed that increased
              motor costs decreased face looking and mutual gaze: Each partner
              looked less at the other's face when their own posture or the
              other's posture required more motor effort to gain visual access
              to the other's face. Caregivers mirrored infants' posture by
              spending more time down on the ground when infants were prone,
              perhaps to facilitate face looking. Infants looked more at toys
              than at their caregiver's face, but caregivers looked at their
              infant's face and at toys in equal amounts. Furthermore, infants
              looked less at toys and faces compared to studies that used
              stationary tasks, suggesting that the attentional demands differ
              in an unconstrained locomotor task. Taken together, findings

               infants spent restricted, the time they engaged in spontaneous
               movement, and the ways in which they were restriction. When

               Healthy full-term infants (n = 22, 2-6 months) participated in

               in five positions: lying prone, lying supine, held in-arms, held
               in a baby carrier, and buckled into a car seat. Mean filtered EMG
               signal and time that muscles were active were calculated. Paired

               Caregivers reported that infants spent 12\% of daily awake time

               (38 males; mean age 4.4 mo, standard deviation [SD] 0.2). Mean
               motor scores were close to normative standards (AIMS 47.7, SD
               19.6; PDMS gross motor quotient [GMQ] 96.3, SD 6.5; PDMS fine
               motor quotient [FMQ] 99.2, SD 4.8). No infant scored below

               likely to be achieved included extended arm support in prone,
               hands to feet in supine, and sitting with arm support. Exposure
               to 'tummy time' while awake was correlated with AIMS scores (r =

               PDMS GMQ 85.7, SD 7.6; PDMS FMQ 88.9, SD 9.0). Only 22\% of
               6-month-olds could sit without arm support versus 50\% expected
               in a normative sample. Remarkably, 22\% of our sample exhibited
               gross motor delays (quotient <78). Tummy time (awake) was
               significantly associated with the AIMS (r = 0.64) and PDMS GMQ (r
               = 0.55) and FMQ (r = 0.33) quotients, even after adjusting for

               Infant seating devices were available in the homes of all of the
               infants whose parents completed the questionnaire during the
               study. Of 187 infants, 176 (94\%) spent 30 minutes or longer in

               central to many components of human behavior and human

               coordination of looking behavior by social partners, gaze
               following. The extant evidence shows that even very young infants
               follow the direction of another's gaze but they do so only in
               highly constrained spatial contexts because gaze direction is not
               a spatially precise cue as to the visual target and not easily
               used in spatially complex social interactions. Our findings,
               derived from the moment-to-moment tracking of eye gaze of
               one-year-olds and their parents as they actively played with
               toys, provide evidence for an alternative pathway, through the
               coordination of hands and eyes in goal-directed action. In
               goal-directed actions, the hands and eyes of the actor are
               tightly coordinated both temporally and spatially, and thus, in
               contexts including manual engagement with objects, hand movements
               and eye movements provide redundant information about where the
               eyes are looking. Our findings show that one-year-olds rarely
               look to the parent's face and eyes in these contexts but rather
               infants and parents coordinate looking behavior without gaze
               following by attending to objects held by the self or the social
               partner. This pathway, through eye-hand coupling, leads to
               coordinated joint switches in visual attention and to an overall
               high rate of looking at the same object at the same time, and may
               be the dominant pathway through which physically active toddlers
               align their looking behavior with a social partner.",

               at-home studies where development of infants' neurobehavior is
               measured using wearable devices. Here, we first developed a
               phenomenological categorization for physical infant-caregiver
               interactions to support five different definitions of C/H
               behaviors. Then, we trained and assessed deep learning-based
               classifiers for their automatic detection from multi-sensor
               wearable recordings that were originally used for mobile
               assessment of infants' motor development. Our results show that
               an automated C/H detection is feasible at few-second temporal
               accuracy. With the best C/H definition, the automated detector
               shows 96\% accuracy and 0.56 kappa, which is slightly less than
               the video-based inter-rater agreement between trained human

               varies with C/H definition reflecting the extent to which
               infants' movements are present in each C/H variant. A systematic
               benchmarking experiment shows that the widely used
               actigraphy-based method ignores the normally occurring C/H
               behaviors. Finally, we show proof-of-concept for the utility of
               the novel classifier in studying C/H behavior across infant

               Therefore, the attainment of motor milestones is expected to play
               a role in cognitive-linguistic development. Early attainment of
               unsupported sitting and independent walking indeed predict better
               spatial cognition and language at later ages. However, evidence
               linking these milestones with the development of spatial language
               and evidence regarding factors that might mediate this relation
               are scarce. The current study examined whether exploration of
               spatial-relational object properties (e.g., the possibility of
               containing or stacking) and exploration of the space through
               self-locomotion mediate the effect of, respectively, age of
               sitting and age of walking on spatial cognition and spatial
               language. Thus, we hypothesized that an earlier age of sitting
               and walking predicts, respectively, higher levels of
               spatial-relational object exploration and exploration through
               self-locomotion, which in turn, predict better spatial cognition
               and spatial language at later ages. Fifty-nine Dutch children
               took part in a longitudinal study. A combination of tests,
               observations, and parental reports was used to measure motor
               development, exploratory behavior (age 20 months), spatial memory
               (age 24 months), spatial processing (age 32 months), and spatial
               language (age 36 months). Results show that attainment of sitting
               predicted spatial memory and spatial language, but
               spatial-relational object exploration did not mediate these
               effects. Attainment of independent walking predicted spatial
               processing and spatial language, and exploration through
               self-locomotion (partially) mediated these relations. These
               findings extend previous work and provide partial support for the
               hypotheses about the mediating role of exploration.",

               accelerometry in young children and to identify gaps in the
               evidence base where further investigation is required. Studies
               evaluating accelerometry methodologies in young children were
               reviewed in two age groups (0-2 years and 3-5 years) to examine:
               (i) which accelerometer should be used, (ii) where the
               accelerometer should be placed, (iii) which epoch should be used,
               (iv) how many days of monitoring are required, (v) how many

               vital step for progressing the time-use epidemiology field. Past
               accelerometer-based measurement protocols are either hindered by
               lack of wear time compliance, or the inability to accurately
               discern activities and postures. Recent work has indicated that
               skin-attached dual-accelerometers exhibit excellent 24-h
               uninterrupted wear time compliance. This study extends this work
               by validating this system for classifying various physical
               activities and sedentary behaviors in children and adults.
               METHODS: Seventy-five participants (42 children) were equipped
               with two Axivity AX3 accelerometers; one attached to their thigh,
               and one to their lower back. Ten activity trials (e.g., sitting,
               standing, lying, walking, running) were performed while under
               direct observation in a lab setting. Various time- and
               frequency-domain features were computed from raw accelerometer
               data, which were then used to train a random forest machine
               learning classifier. Model performance was evaluated using
               leave-one-out cross-validation. The efficacy of the dual-sensor
               protocol (relative to single sensors) was evaluated by repeating
               the modeling process with each sensor individually. RESULTS:
               Machine learning models were able to differentiate between six
               distinct activity classes with exceptionally high accuracy in
               both adults (99.1\%) and children (97.3\%). When a single thigh
               or back accelerometer was used, there was a pronounced drop in
               accuracy for nonambulatory activities (up to a 26.4\% decline).
               When examining the features used for model training, those that
               took the orientation of both sensors into account concurrently
               were more important predictors. CONCLUSIONS: When previous wear
               time compliance results are taken together with our findings, it
               represents a promising step forward for monitoring and
               understanding 24-h time-use behaviors. The next step will be to
               examine the generalizability of these findings in a free-living

              respect to achievable scientific questions. Objective: This study
              assessed systematically the effects of IMU recording
              configurations (placement and number of IMU sensors, sampling
              frequency, and sensor modality) on the high temporal resolution
              detections of postures and movements, and on their lower temporal
              resolution derivative statistics when the data represents
              naturalistic daily activity without excessively repetitive
              movements. Methods: We used a dataset from spontaneously moving
              infants (N=41; age range 4-18 months) recorded with a multisensor
              wearable suit. The analysis benchmark was obtained using human
              annotations of postures and movements from a synchronously
              recorded video, and the reference IMU recording configuration
              included 4 IMU sensors collecting triaxial accelerometer and
              gyroscope modalities at 52 Hz. Then, we systematically tested how
              the algorithmic classification of postures (N=7), and movements
              (N=9), as well as their distributions and a derivative motor
              performance score, are affected by reducing IMU data sampling
              frequency, sensor modality, and sensor placement. Results: Our
              results show that reducing the number of sensors has a significant
              effect on classifier performance, and the single sensor
              configurations were nonfeasible (posture classification Cohen
              kappa<0.75; movement<0.45). Reducing sensor modalities to
              accelerometer only, that is, dropping gyroscope data, leads to a
              modest reduction in movement classification performance
              (kappa=0.50-0.53). However, the sampling frequency could be
              reduced from 52 to 6 Hz with negligible effects on the
              classifications (posture kappa=0.90-0.92; movement=0.56-0.58).
              Conclusions: The present findings highlight the significant
              trade-offs between IMU recording configurations and the
              attainability of sufficiently reliable analyses at different
              levels. Notably, the single-sensor recordings employed in most of
              the literature and wearable solutions are of very limited use when
              assessing the key aspects of real-world movement behavior at
              relevant temporal resolutions. The minimal configuration with an
              acceptable classifier performance includes at least a combination
              of one upper and one lower extremity sensor, at least 13 Hz
              sampling frequency, and at least an accelerometer, but preferably
              also a gyroscope (posture kappa=0.89-0.91; movement=0.50-0.53).
              These findings have direct implications for the design of future
              studies and wearable solutions that aim to quantify spontaneously
              occurring postures and movements in natural behaviors.",

               months of age, total and individual equipment use was determined

               using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale. Statistically significant

               equipment use and infant motor development (r = -0.50, P = 0.001)
               and individual pieces of equipment [exersaucer (r = -0.58, P =

               suggest that infants who have high equipment use tend to score
               lower on infant motor development or that infants who have low

  abstract  = "We propose that infant carrying is a biological norm for human
               caregiving, given that human infants have evolved a capacity to
               cling onto an upright caregiver whose body co-evolved to enable
               offspring carrying. The origins of this mutual adaptation may
               date back 4 million years, with the emergence of bipedalism,
               which precluded the infant horizontal and gravity-supported
               position on the back of a quadrupedal caregiver. We describe
               infant cooperative reflexes and behaviors, including the
               carrying-induced calming response and discuss hypotheses for the
               invention of infant carrier tools. Carrying involves several
               physiological and behavioral parent-infant co-adaptations that
               imply it is an evolutionarily conserved strategy. Epigenetic
               transmission of reproductive behavior through generations affects
               the development of the offspring, as well as the mental health of
               the parent. Carrying might have contributed to the evolution of
               Hominidae, potentially aiding dexterity, handedness, language
               acquisition, and social interactions. We review the evolutionary
               milestones and time points where the infant-caregiver
               interactions might have changed, exploring infant carrying as it
               intersects with biological and cultural evolution. We briefly
               summarize the effects of infant carrying on physiological,
               epigenetic, and socio-emotional outcomes.",
