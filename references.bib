               which severely restrict the body and limbs. The present study
               explored the variability and use of containment devices in U.S.
               and Tajik infants. Using time diaries, we compared 12-month-olds
               in the U.S. and Tajikistan on the types of containments used and
               time spent in them throughout the day. During the day, Tajik
               infants accumulated more time in gahvoras than infants in the
               U.S. spent in cribs, primarily used for sleep, suggesting
               gahvoras served other functions. Given the availability of other
               devices, U.S. infants' time was distributed in short yet frequent
               bouts across devices. Accumulated time in these containments
               matched accumulated time Tajik infants spent in gahvoras. Tajik
               infants accumulated more unrestricted time on the ground, which
               was distributed in prolonged bouts, than U.S. infants. Findings
               highlight differences in infants' everyday experiences during the
               developmental period when motor skills emerge. By embracing
               commonalities and exploring differences between cultures, this

               selected because it relates to the development of a variety of

              positions and motor development of infants born preterm who were
              classified as high risk. Subjects were 60 parent-infant dyads
              attending a developmental follow-up clinic. METHODS: Parents
              reported the duration of infant equipment use and the predominant
              positions in which their infants played in the previous month.
              Infants were assessed using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS).
              RESULTS: Equipment use was not related to motor development;
              however, the duration of carrying was negatively related to the
              sit subscale of the AIMS (r = -0.31, p < 0.05). As a group, the
              infants in this sample spent more time in the relatively less
              active play positions of sitting and supine than in the positions
              of prone and standing. CONCLUSIONS: Therapists should consider the
              use of equipment and specific play positions to enhance motor
              development of infants born preterm and work with parents to
              promote an understanding of the importance of providing their

               around.'' This book covers the development of perception in
               detail from birth through toddlerhood, beginning with the
               development of communication, going on to perceiving and acting
               on objects, and then to locomotion. It is more than a

               outlines the ecological approach and shows how it underlies
               ``higher'' cognitive processes, such as concept formation, as
               well as discovery of the basic affordances of the environment.

               the impact of infant body position on muscle activity is unknown.
               The objective of this study was to evaluate neck and back muscle
               activity of healthy infants in common positions and baby devices.
               Healthy full-term infants (n = 22, 2-6 months) participated in
               this experimental study. Daily sleep and positioning were
               reported by caregivers. Cervical paraspinal and erector spinae
               muscle activity was measured using surface electromyography (EMG)
               in five positions: lying prone, lying supine, held in-arms, held
               in a baby carrier, and buckled into a car seat. Mean filtered EMG
               signal and time that muscles were active were calculated. Paired
               t-tests were used to compare positions to the prone condition.
               Caregivers reported that infants spent 12\% of daily awake time
               prone, 43\% in supine-lying baby gear, and 44\% held in-arms or
               upright in a baby carrier. Infants exhibited highest erector

               promotes neck and back muscle activity. Carrying babies in-arms
               or in baby carriers may also be beneficial to neck muscle

               long-form recordings of infant position (supine, prone, sitting,

               classification of data from inertial sensors worn on infants'

  abstract = "Background: Human movement activity is commonly recorded with
              inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors in many science
              disciplines. The IMU data can be used for an algorithmic detection
              of different postures and movements, which may support more
              detailed assessments of complex behaviors, such as daily
              activities. Studies on human behavior in real-life environments
              need to strike a balance between simplifying the recording
              settings and preserving sufficient analytic gains. It is poorly
              understood, however, what the trade-offs are between alternative
              recording configurations and the attainable analyses of
              naturalistic behavior at different levels of inspection, or with
              respect to achievable scientific questions. Objective: This study
              assessed systematically the effects of IMU recording
              configurations (placement and number of IMU sensors, sampling
              frequency, and sensor modality) on the high temporal resolution
              detections of postures and movements, and on their lower temporal
              resolution derivative statistics when the data represents
              naturalistic daily activity without excessively repetitive
              movements. Methods: We used a dataset from spontaneously moving
              infants (N=41; age range 4-18 months) recorded with a multisensor
              wearable suit. The analysis benchmark was obtained using human
              annotations of postures and movements from a synchronously
              recorded video, and the reference IMU recording configuration
              included 4 IMU sensors collecting triaxial accelerometer and
              gyroscope modalities at 52 Hz. Then, we systematically tested how
              the algorithmic classification of postures (N=7), and movements
              (N=9), as well as their distributions and a derivative motor
              performance score, are affected by reducing IMU data sampling
              frequency, sensor modality, and sensor placement. Results: Our
              results show that reducing the number of sensors has a significant
              effect on classifier performance, and the single sensor
              configurations were nonfeasible (posture classification Cohen
              kappa<0.75; movement<0.45). Reducing sensor modalities to
              accelerometer only, that is, dropping gyroscope data, leads to a
              modest reduction in movement classification performance
              (kappa=0.50-0.53). However, the sampling frequency could be
              reduced from 52 to 6 Hz with negligible effects on the
              classifications (posture kappa=0.90-0.92; movement=0.56-0.58).
              Conclusions: The present findings highlight the significant
              trade-offs between IMU recording configurations and the
              attainability of sufficiently reliable analyses at different
              levels. Notably, the single-sensor recordings employed in most of
              the literature and wearable solutions are of very limited use when
              assessing the key aspects of real-world movement behavior at
              relevant temporal resolutions. The minimal configuration with an
              acceptable classifier performance includes at least a combination
              of one upper and one lower extremity sensor, at least 13 Hz
              sampling frequency, and at least an accelerometer, but preferably
              also a gyroscope (posture kappa=0.89-0.91; movement=0.50-0.53).
              These findings have direct implications for the design of future
              studies and wearable solutions that aim to quantify spontaneously
              occurring postures and movements in natural behaviors.",

               relationship between both total equipment use and the use of
               individual pieces of equipment and infant motor development. At 8
               months of age, total and individual equipment use was determined
               by parental survey and infant motor development was assessed
               using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale. Statistically significant
               correlations were found for the relationships between total
               equipment use and infant motor development (r = -0.50, P = 0.001)
               and individual pieces of equipment [exersaucer (r = -0.58, P =
               0.001), highchair (r = -0.32, P = 0.04), and infant seat (r =
               -0.32, P = 0.03)] and infant motor development. These findings
               suggest that infants who have high equipment use tend to score
               lower on infant motor development or that infants who have low
               equipment use tend to score higher on infant motor development.
               Limitations of this cross-sectional study make it difficult to
               determine causality between these constructs. If equipment use is
               found to be causally related to infant motor development and
               predictive of later motor development in a future prospective
               study, parental education emphasizing the moderate use of
               equipment within the home environment might be warranted.",
