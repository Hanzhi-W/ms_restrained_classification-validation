  abstract = "Background: Human movement activity is commonly recorded with
              inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors in many science
              disciplines. The IMU data can be used for an algorithmic detection
              of different postures and movements, which may support more
              detailed assessments of complex behaviors, such as daily
              activities. Studies on human behavior in real-life environments
              need to strike a balance between simplifying the recording
              settings and preserving sufficient analytic gains. It is poorly
              understood, however, what the trade-offs are between alternative
              recording configurations and the attainable analyses of
              naturalistic behavior at different levels of inspection, or with
              respect to achievable scientific questions. Objective: This study
              assessed systematically the effects of IMU recording
              configurations (placement and number of IMU sensors, sampling
              frequency, and sensor modality) on the high temporal resolution
              detections of postures and movements, and on their lower temporal
              resolution derivative statistics when the data represents
              naturalistic daily activity without excessively repetitive
              movements. Methods: We used a dataset from spontaneously moving
              infants (N=41; age range 4-18 months) recorded with a multisensor
              wearable suit. The analysis benchmark was obtained using human
              annotations of postures and movements from a synchronously
              recorded video, and the reference IMU recording configuration
              included 4 IMU sensors collecting triaxial accelerometer and
              gyroscope modalities at 52 Hz. Then, we systematically tested how
              the algorithmic classification of postures (N=7), and movements
              (N=9), as well as their distributions and a derivative motor
              performance score, are affected by reducing IMU data sampling
              frequency, sensor modality, and sensor placement. Results: Our
              results show that reducing the number of sensors has a significant
              effect on classifier performance, and the single sensor
              configurations were nonfeasible (posture classification Cohen
              kappa<0.75; movement<0.45). Reducing sensor modalities to
              accelerometer only, that is, dropping gyroscope data, leads to a
              modest reduction in movement classification performance
              (kappa=0.50-0.53). However, the sampling frequency could be
              reduced from 52 to 6 Hz with negligible effects on the
              classifications (posture kappa=0.90-0.92; movement=0.56-0.58).
              Conclusions: The present findings highlight the significant
              trade-offs between IMU recording configurations and the
              attainability of sufficiently reliable analyses at different
              levels. Notably, the single-sensor recordings employed in most of
              the literature and wearable solutions are of very limited use when
              assessing the key aspects of real-world movement behavior at
              relevant temporal resolutions. The minimal configuration with an
              acceptable classifier performance includes at least a combination
              of one upper and one lower extremity sensor, at least 13 Hz
              sampling frequency, and at least an accelerometer, but preferably
              also a gyroscope (posture kappa=0.89-0.91; movement=0.50-0.53).
              These findings have direct implications for the design of future
              studies and wearable solutions that aim to quantify spontaneously
              occurring postures and movements in natural behaviors.",
